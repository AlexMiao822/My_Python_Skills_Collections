They contain Python bytecode. Precisely when they're created and updated is IDE/interpreter-dependent (please correct me if I'm wrong here).

Since Python has to be converted to bytecode before it can be interpreted, keeping .pyc files around can help speed up execution, since you don't have to recompile. If there's a .pyc file around, there should be a .py file around with the same name.

Here are some more details:

You can also force their creation to speed up execution (see the link for details).

Fun fact: You should be able to ship only the .pyc files in your module if you want lightweight/basic obfuscation in your shipped application.
